            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the truth of that, which almoſt by the experience and practiſe of three whole yeares I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be true, it is the moſt peſtiferous, &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hereſie of all others, becauſe there is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any one particular erroneous &amp; Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall phantaſie,<note place="margin">HN. his hereſie mingled of all hereſies.</note> whereof the <hi>Familie of Loue</hi> hath not borrowed one braunche or other thereof, to peece vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues this their broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religion.</p>

            <p>The au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient and famous Towne of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> was in the troubleſome tyme of <hi>Queene Maries</hi> perſecution a ſweete and and comfortable mother of the bodyes, and a tender nourſe of the ſoules of Gods children: which towne was the rather at that tyme frequented, becauſe it aforded many godly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Martyrs, whiche continually with their bloud watered thoſe ſeedes, whiche by the preachyng of the worde had bene ſowne moſt plentifully in the hartes of Chriſtians in the dayes of good Kyng Edward.

For whereas you make a circumloqution and ſay, <hi>it may not bee denied, for as much as God is loue and the other must conſequently or neceſſarily follow.</hi> I vnderſtand <hi>HN.</hi> very well, when he ſayth God is loue, it is very true, and therefore I take it that in diuers places he vſeth this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe terme <hi>the loue,</hi> for <hi>the Lord our God</hi> as a worde that is equiualente of ſignification.

Geue me leaue to vſe your own wordes, neither is <hi>the conſequent good:</hi> nor doth it <hi>follow of neceſſitie</hi> for which you induce it.

How this conſequent doth halte in his followyng, he that knoweth what a conſequent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth can eaſely conſider.

followeth it to be vnderſtode, what his opinion is of our Sacramentes. And firſt to ſpeake of baptiſme (For of the holy Sacrament of the ſupper of our Lord he hath written very litle) what he attributeth to our Church therein is playne, that vnleſſe we haue our foregoing in the doctrine of the loue, we are not to be counted of him, and his Fam, to be baptiſed ones. To the which I will aunſwere briefly, if firſt he ſhall ſatiſfy me in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: Whether when there was no Family of Loue, there were no vpright baptiſme in England? If he ſay there was a lawfull baptiſme, than is there an vpright baptiſme without the foregoing of his louely doctrine, and without his Family a true Chriſtian baptiſme. If he ſay there was none, than doe I aunſwere, that theſe Famelers in England are not rightly baptiſed, &amp; ſpeake the truth, &amp; worke righteouſnes, or an acceptable worke in the ſight of God. To the which, if the Familye ſhall further aunſwere, though then they were not, yet ſince they haue bin rightly baptiſed. This it may be, <hi>Vitels</hi> the Ioyner will aunſwere to approue his hereticall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour at <hi>Cholcheſter:</hi> ad to this I am to reply, that if the Fam. acknowledge a <hi>rebaptization,</hi> then are they hypocrites all the ſort of them. For they in their laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (being <hi>a rehearſall of their doctrine, beliefe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>) affirme,<note place="margin">Confeſ. leafe. 7. a.

Therefore if they be rebaptiſed, they be double faced diſſemblers. Furthermore if they ſhall affirme that they vſe not other Sacramentes &amp;c. than is vſed in the Church of England, that is: in their Fam. in the Church of England, becauſe it was ſayd in the firſt Article, that we haue no Church without their Family: I aunſwere: They pretend in their confeſſion, they deale faythfully with all men: If this be their fayth, what I pray you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1438:30"/>
is their falſhode. Furthermore I let paſſe to repeate, much leſſe to confute, that fond opinion of thoſe vaine heads, which thought the partyes baptiſed of heretiques, ought to be rebaptiſed agayne. Of this opinion the Fam. of Loue ſemeth to lyke very well, for becauſe they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme before, that without this Fam. there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian baptiſme.</p>

               <p>Now followeth your ſecond place out of the <hi>1.</hi> Cor. which proueth that the Children of God are with him, Ioyned and vnited together in one ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Somewhat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our vniting, which hath bin tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before. To abſolue all the doubt which ariſeth in this place, this queſtion is here to be demaunded. What is it to be made one ſpirite with Chriſt? If you ſhall aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that to be our ſpirit &amp;c. is to haue our ſpirit confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Chriſtes ſpirite in the ſame ſubſtance, than doe I reply: that this your aunſwere is a darke and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Paradox.</hi> For onely bodily and corporall ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are confounded, and mingled, ſo that incorporall and immateriall eſſences cannot be coupled in the ſame third matter, as farre as yet my reaſon can conprehend. <hi>A ſpirit ſayth our Sauiour Chriſt hath not fleſh and bones:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24.49.</note> that is: there is a ſpirite no earthly or corruptible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or corporall ſubſtaunce. Therefore our ioyning and knitting vnto Chriſt, is not in matter, or ſubſtance, or being: but in ſpirit, and fayth. Thus ſée you than that your imagination is but the ſhadow of a ſlomber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you doted all this while, that you demed our earthly and terren nature, to be embodied, and incorporated with him in perfect being, that is in his heauenly and diuine nature: and ſo we being men to become Gods to him, and he being God doth become man to vs. This your fantaſye is more apparant in <hi>HN.</hi> his dictata or documentable ſentences:<note place="margin">Cap. 6. ſent. 3.</note> but all your fantaſies are but as miſtes before the ſonne, and the ſléepes of a ſick man, whoſe dreames hand together.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To be vnited in ſpirit what it is.</note>To be vnited and conioyned in ſpirite with God is nothing els, but to draw nearer vnto the image of our

               <p>Now concerning that laſt place by you alledged out of <hi>S.

their hereſie they ſo conſpire, either with other, that it clearely, and to <hi>HN.</hi> his perpetuall ſhame it may be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which <hi>M.

As for <hi>HN.</hi> though it ſéemeth his wit is peſtilent enough to peruert y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth: yet by <hi>Dauid George</hi> his Maiſters whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng him forward, hauyng of him ſelfe a cankred mynde agaynſt the truth, and a ſwellyng hart: he became x. fold more the ſonne of perdition, in beyng wholy bent to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſimple that thereby he might not ſo much be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he pretended, as increaſe his priuate wealth, which by his fiſkyng to and fro was not a litle empayred.</p>
               <p>For to affirme that in word, which the deed it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth to be true, ſufficiently apparaunt it is that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid George</hi> firſt put downe the principles of this ſecte: which when he had ſo done, and with writhyng and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng had brought his hereſie into tune, <hi>HN.</hi> was now by him further to be inſtructed how with a malitious mynde and perilous wit, he might runne deſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at will, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at pleaſure vpon this ſtraunge doctrine, and new tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned opinions.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtraine wheron this further heretical accord was to be ſtretched, was this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after <hi>D.

And ſeing the daunger was not ſmale to be outragious in ſo great a matter: he thought it ſufficient that his ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary bare a good hart, &amp; ſtode ſingle in myndedly vnto his doctrine, to kéepe their conſciences to themſelues, and for their further quietnes ſake to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme themſelues to any people whatſoeuer, amongeſt whome they liued &amp; with whome they had to deale. This as it was a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

point, ſo was it alſo a peſtiferous poyſon wherewith the diuel hath deceiued many a ſimple ſoule, and thrown many a ſtumbling block in the way of the wauering and weake harted Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>That this was <hi>Dauid George</hi> his opinion, and that hereafter I be not ſayd to ſlaunder him,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. pag. 32.</note> let <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>To the which I further adde: Of this opinion is that wretched man <hi>HN.</hi> and by this bayte hath he choaked more Chriſtians then by any other whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>For hereby in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of Papiſtry he had his faultors alſo whom by the <hi>Suthwarke Ioyner</hi> he licenſed to be preſent at Idolaters ſeruice, and to kéepe their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſecret vnto themſelues, hauing taught them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was an indifferent thing to hould any thing, ſo they kept the doctrine of the Loue by him taught vnto them. And this is manifeſt in his Euangelye, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that <hi>O yes</hi> which he maketh before his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous proclamation, to the whole world, in theſe words following.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then the which wordes what may be ſayd more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than like, or what euen belched out of the bottomles pit more blaſphemous, if all the fiendes of hell would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together to afford a graceles and godles ſpeach, whereby the hartes of them that ſtagger in the way of

               <p>VNto many it may ſéeme ſtraunge, and ſcarſe credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto ſome, that there ſhould lyue a people vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, whiche not holdyng them ſelues content with the written word of God, would adde vnto it ſome tricke of their own deuiſing: which although they agréed as euill as a new péece of clothe vnto an old garment, yet fayne would they their toyes were pewefellowes with the ſacred truth of God, not onely to match, but ſome tymes to geue a checkemate vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>Yet vnto him that equally conſidereth all things with an vnpartiall eye, it is eaſely to be ſene, that it was not onely the practiſe of the Popiſhe Prelacie, ſo to outface the ſimplicity of the Scripture, partly with the bringyng their blynd and vnſauery traditions, partly with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyng of the church, with the intollerable yoke of their vnwritten verities: but the dealyng of the <hi>Anabaptiſtes</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and all other like Heretiques hath agréed in this accord, that when the touchſtone would not ſerue, and a naked truth would not ſo much hide as vnto all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declare their miſbehauiour, ſtraight with the preſence of the ſpirite &amp; cloke of zeale they haue laboured to ſhroude this ſo great impietie.</p>
               <p>For hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it enſued that the Romaniſtes ſo cloyed the church with their fond feſtiuals, leud Legendes, and ſo ſtuffed into the ſeruice of God ſuch ſtore of idle reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and vnneceſſary viſions, that by the reading of them openly in the congregation, the holy and canonicall wrightinges of the holy ghoſt were wholy abandoned and cleane caſt out of the dores. And this was that which the Anabaptiſtes, and other heretiques haue practiſed, which when they had no witnes or warrant from the written word and approued truth of God, they forged ſtraunge euidence, and that which with blaſphemie they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1438:63"/>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ground of their miſdemeanour, they aunſwered: <hi>The ſpirite thus commaundeth me,</hi>

                  <hi>and thus the Father hath ſayd:</hi> ſo that when they wanted the worde they boaſted of the ſpirite, and affirmed that they had their doctrine from heauen reuealed vnto them.

more at large.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point of the firſt part. <hi>vz the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God are declared vnto HN,</hi> he auoucheth no proofe to verifie it, and albeit God reueiles his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that is both his word to inſtruct, as alſo his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes agaynſt the wicked,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.164.</note> that is his ſword to deuoure, if <hi>HN.</hi> were one that were méeke the Lord would guide him in iudgement <hi>Pſal. 25.9.</hi> But becauſe his ſpeaches te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that he feareth not God, therfore the Lordes ſecrets are not reueiled vnto him. verſ. <hi>14.</hi> e.</p>
               <p>The thyrd point, of <hi>HN.</hi> his Reuelation, <hi>vid. the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of Chriſt in the laſt tyme,</hi> is all one agréeyng with the firſt. His laſt and fourth note <hi>videl.</hi> that the Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is reuealed vnto him is not ſo euident as he thought to haue made it. For the places by him alledged out of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiell. 37.9.10. verſ. b.</hi> proue that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould certainly returne out of Captiuitie, and this was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto them, by the viſible ſigne of the rayſing of dead bones, that God was able to do the one, as the other. Howbeit yet I ſée not how hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>HN.</hi> would conclud his Reuelation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the Reſurrection, for that this place hath not any ſuch meanyng. The place of <hi>Iohn. 5. c. verſ. 28.29.</hi> truly proueth the Reſurrection, yet it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth not one word of Reuelation. <hi>Rom. 8. b. 11. verſ.</hi> proueth that as God was able to rayſe vp Chriſt beyng dead, accordyng to his manhode, ſo is God able to rayſe vs vp that be his Children, both in ſoule and body to his eternall kyngdome. The <hi>Philipians. 3. b. 11. verſ. S. Paule</hi> ſheweth to attaine vnto the Reſurrection of the dead was his great deſire: where theſe wordes <hi>the Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> are not taken (as <hi>HN.</hi> would ſéeme to alledge by his knittyng them with them which went before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinyng the ſame matter) for <hi>the Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> before euerlaſtyng lyfe it ſelfe, and the participation therof after the Reſurrection with the choſen Saintes of God. <hi>1. Theſ. 4.17. d.</hi> and <hi>1. Cor. 5. verſ. 4. a.</hi> So that <hi>HN.</hi> very vnſkilfully hath alledged this place for the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1438:66"/>
which albeit it were by him rightly quoted, yet ſée I not how thereupon his propoſition concernyng <hi>the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead is reueiled vnto HN.</hi> ſhould be rightly concluded.</p>

                  <hi>The prayer of a righteous man auayleth much if it be feruent,</hi> yet becauſe our prayers are not ſo perfect, no not in the iuſt man as they ought to be, therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe that we obtaine not at Gods hand becauſe we aſke amiſſe:<note place="margin">Iam. 4.3.</note> neither did Chriſt obtaine at his fathers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>that the cup of his death might paſſe from him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26. cap. verſ. 39.42.</note> for that it was not ſo agreable with Gods will, nor expedient for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhyng of our ſaluation. So that when we accompliſh not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition in our prayers that God hath preſcribed in his word, we are not to bynde or charge God with his promiſe, for that he knoweth better what to geue vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1438:83"/>
we know what, or how to aſke of him.</p>
               <p>So that now we ſée that it is but a vayne kyndnes, which <hi>Theophilus</hi> in this place threapeth on God, when as either hee will haue God to bow vnto him at euery becke, or els by and by he will make him the authour of ſinne. For what is this that <hi>Theophilus</hi> doth els burthen him withall: that if we pray &amp; not helpe come, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are we guiltles of the tranſgreſſion. But to accuſe God to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to our miſbehauiour, which thyng be far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Now if <hi>Theophilus</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this, what, is it not truth, becauſe he can not conceiue it? Gods iudgementes are alwayes true and iuſt, though often ſecret, and thoſe thynges whiche we vnderſtand not at the firſt, let vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reuerence and worſhyp them then wonder at them. God when he leaueth vs to our ſelues and puniſheth one ſinne with an other, doth that moſt righteouſly in him ſelfe, that ſinfull fleſh doth ſée no reaſon in. Shall the pot reaſon with the potter, becauſe he made him not a veſſell vnto honor?<note place="margin">Ierem. 18.</note> ſhall the axe extoll it ſelfe agaynſt him that heweth therewith? may God make his creatures as ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth beſt to his ſingular wiſedome, and ſhall he not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them as he will, when he hath created them? God geueth his children pardon in his mercy, yet he that fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his mercy, not firſt fully hauing ſatiſfied his iuſtice deceaueth his owne ſoule ere he be aware. So that when any man ſhall preſume vpon repentaunce &amp; fall in hope to riſe, true it is he that hath promiſed pardon vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, hath not promiſed that we ſhall liue till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that we may haue leyſure to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he that is not fit to day, the Lord knoweth how fit he wilbe to morrow.</p>
               <p>Now it is alſo moſt aſſuredly true that albeit God in reſpect of him ſelfe, for Chriſtes ſake, doth fréely forgeue both the fault and the puniſhment, yet becauſe he will not haue men dally with his iuſtice, vpon the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinnes of the godly committed before men, hee taketh open pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment leaſt the enemy ſhould haue a cauſe to rayle. This is manifeſt by kyng <hi>Dauids</hi> example, he ſinned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb facs="tcp:1438:84"/>
in the ſight of God and before <hi>Iſraell,</hi> God freely forgaue him both the puniſhment, and the fault: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men becauſe the enemyes of God had openly a cauſe to blaſpheme, therfore the Lord tooke away the child that was borne in adultery.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.10.</note> Furthermore when he numbred the people, and had continued in the ſame ſinne, without any notable repentaunce <hi>9.</hi> monethes and <hi>20.</hi> dayes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter albeit he prayed hartly, yet was his ſinne puniſhed by a great and ſeuere ſcourge, as is manifeſtly to be ſene in the place of that Hiſtory. By which places it is to be vnderſtode that we ought not to offend in hope of pardon, neither that God is faultie, who will not boulſter vs in our faultes nor ſo eaſly be ſatiſfied in his iuſtice as we imagine of.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Theophilus</hi> déeme that herein he is not fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, for that this queſtion is of him that prayeth before ſinne committed,<note place="margin">Math. 9.4.5.</note> and both theſe examples are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently playne, I further aunſwere him, that before <hi>Iudas</hi> honge him ſelfe, he was ſory and made a ſhewe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repentaunce as by his reſtitution may eaſly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: yet God ſtayed him not here, but becauſe hee ſhould be a notable ſpectacle of Gods vengeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to them that were then vnborne, that no man be ſo hardy to ſinne agaynſt his conſcience: he ranne ſo farre that he caſte himſelfe willingly and wittyngly away, and yet albeit God did not bow to heare him nor vouchſafe him pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſay that he is giltles, for beyng condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that tranſgreſſion?</p>
