            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the which I will aun≈øwere briefly, if fir≈øt he ≈øhall ≈øati≈øfy me in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: Whether when there was no Family of Loue, there were no vpright bapti≈øme in England? If he ≈øay there was a lawfull bapti≈øme, than is there an vpright bapti≈øme without the foregoing of his louely doctrine, and without his Family a true Chri≈øtian bapti≈øme. If he ≈øay there was none, than doe I aun≈øwere, that the≈øe Famelers in England are not rightly bapti≈øed, &amp; ≈øpeake the truth, &amp; worke righteou≈ønes, or an acceptable worke in the ≈øight of God. To the which, if the Familye ≈øhall further aun≈øwere, though then they were not, yet ≈øince they haue bin rightly bapti≈øed.

Furthermore if they ≈øhall affirme that they v≈øe not other Sacramentes &amp;c. than is v≈øed in the Church of England, that is: in their Fam. in the Church of England, becau≈øe it was ≈øayd in the fir≈øt Article, that we haue no Church without their Family: I aun≈øwere: They pretend in their confe≈ø≈øion, they deale faythfully with all men: If this be their fayth, what I pray you

Furthermore I let pa≈ø≈øe to repeate, much le≈ø≈øe to confute, that fond opinion of tho≈øe vaine heads, which thought the partyes bapti≈øed of heretiques, ought to be rebapti≈øed agayne.

               <p>For to affirme that in word, which the deed it ≈øelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth to be true, ≈øufficiently apparaunt it is that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid George</hi> fir≈øt put downe the principles of this ≈øecte: which when he had ≈øo done, and with writhyng and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtyng had brought his here≈øie into tune, <hi>HN.</hi> was now by him further to be in≈øtructed how with a malitious mynde and perilous wit, he might runne de≈øca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t at will, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at plea≈øure vpon this ≈øtraunge doctrine, and new tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned opinions.</p>

               <p>VNto many it may ≈ø√©eme ≈øtraunge, and ≈øcar≈øe credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto ≈øome, that there ≈øhould lyue a people vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, whiche not holdyng them ≈øelues content with the written word of God, would adde vnto it ≈øome tricke of their own deui≈øing: which although they agr√©ed as euill as a new p√©ece of clothe vnto an old garment, yet fayne would they their toyes were pewefellowes with the ≈øacred truth of God, not onely to match, but ≈øome tymes to geue a checkemate vnto the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>Yet vnto him that equally con≈øidereth all things with an vnpartiall eye, it is ea≈øely to be ≈øene, that it was not onely the practi≈øe of the Popi≈øhe Prelacie, ≈øo to outface the ≈øimplicity of the Scripture, partly with the bringyng their blynd and vn≈øauery traditions, partly with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyng of the church, with the intollerable yoke of their vnwritten verities: but the dealyng of the <hi>Anabapti≈øtes</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and all other like Heretiques hath agr√©ed in this accord, that when the touch≈øtone would not ≈øerue, and a naked truth would not ≈øo much hide as vnto all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> declare their mi≈øbehauiour, ≈øtraight with the pre≈øence of the ≈øpirite &amp; cloke of zeale they haue laboured to ≈øhroude this ≈øo great impietie.</p>
